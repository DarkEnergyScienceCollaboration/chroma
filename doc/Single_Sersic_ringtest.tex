\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Cosmic shear experiments aim to constrain cosmological parameters by
measuring the small departure from statistical isotropy of distant
galaxy shapes induced by the gravitational lensing from foreground
large scale structure.  The shapes of galaxy images collected from
telescopes, however, are not only affected by cosmic shear (typically
a $\sim$ 1\% effect), but also by the combined point spread function
(PSF) of the atmosphere (for ground-based experiments), telescope
optics, and the image sensor (often a few \% effect).  The shape of
this additional convolution kernel is typically constrained from the
shapes of stars, which are effectively point sources before being
smeared by the PSF.  Galaxy images can then be deconvolved with the
estimated convolution kernel.  Implicit in this approach is the
assumption that the galactic kernel is the same as the stellar kernel.
Effects that make the PSF dependent on wavelength will violate this
assumption, as stars and galaxies at different redshifts, have
different spectral energy distributions, and hence different PSFs.

Examples of wavelength-dependent PSF contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item atmospheric differential chromatic refraction (DCR)
  \item atmospheric seeing
  \item telescope optics DCR
  \item photoconversion depth in the sensor and subsequent charge diffusion
\end{itemize}

This note will focus on PSF mis-estimations due to the first of the
above effects, though the conclusions are applicable to any situation
in which the bias due to using the wrong PSF is estimated using a ring
test with a simple model parameterization.

\section{Analytic Expectations}\label{sec:analytic}
\citet{Plazas2012} derived analytic expressions for the bias expected
in weak lensing measurements due to differential chromatic refraction.
We summarize the main points of their argument here.

Let $R(\lambda, z_a)$ be the refraction towards the zenith of a photon
with wavelength $\lambda$ and true zenith angle (before refraction)
$z_A$.  The refraction can be factored into
\begin{equation}
  R(\lambda; z_a) =  g(\lambda) \mathrm{tan}(z_a)
  \label{eqn:Rlamza}
\end{equation}
and $g(\lambda)$, which implicitly depends on air pressure,
temperature, and the partial pressure of water vapor, and can be
obtained from \citet{Edlen1953} and \citet{Coleman1960}.  For
monochromatic sources, the only effect is to move the apparent
position of the object.  For sources which are not monochromatic
(i.e. all real sources), having a wavelength density of surviving
photons (i.e. the product of the source photon density and the total
system throughput function) given by $\mathrm{p}_{\lambda}(\lambda)$,
the mismatched displacements of different wavelengths introduces a
convolution kernel in the zenith direction that can be written in
terms of the inverse of Equation \ref{eqn:Rlamza}:
\begin{equation}
  h(R) = \frac{p_\lambda(\lambda(R; z_a)) \left|\od{\lambda}{R}\right|}{\int{p_\lambda(\lambda) \dif{\lambda}}}
  \label{eqn:convker}
\end{equation}
This kernel can largely be characterized in terms of its first and
second central moments given by:
\begin{equation}
  \bar{R} = \int{h(R) R \dif{R} } = \frac{\int{R(\lambda; z_a) p_\lambda(\lambda)\dif{\lambda} }}{\int{p_\lambda(\lambda) \dif{\lambda}}}
  \label{eqn:rbar}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  V = \int{h(R) (R - \bar{R})^2 \dif{R} } = \frac{\int{(R(\lambda; z_a) - \bar{R})^2 p_\lambda(\lambda)\dif{\lambda} }}{\int{p_\lambda(\lambda) \dif{\lambda}}}
  \label{eqn:V}
\end{equation}

Galaxy shapes can be characterized by the quadrupole moments of their
light distribution given by:
\begin{equation}
  I_{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{f}\int{\dif{x} \dif{y} I(x,y)\mu - \bar{\mu}(\nu - \bar{\nu})}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\mu} = \frac{1}{f}\int{\dif{x} \dif{y} I(x,y)\mu}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  f = \int{\dif{x} \dif{y} I(x,y)}
\end{equation}

In particular, galaxy size and 2-component ellipticity are frequently defined as:
\begin{equation}
  r^2 = I_{xx} + I_{yy}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  e_1 = \frac{I_{xx} - I_{yy}}{r^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  e_2 = \frac{2 I_{xy}}{r^2}
\end{equation}

For the case of differential chromatic refraction, we can set, without
loss of generality, the $x$ direction to be towards zenith.  The
effect of DCR is then to take $I_{xx} \rightarrow I_{xx} + V$, which
also takes $r^2 \rightarrow r^2 + V$, but leaves $I_{yy}$ and $I_{xy}$
unchanged.  The ellipticity and size parameterizations are defined in
terms of the quadrupole moments before the galaxy light distribution
is smeared by the PSF, but we only have access to the light
distribution after convolution.  The second moments before ($I^g$) and
after ($I^o$) convolution are related via the second moments of the
PSF ($I^*$) like $I^g = I^o - I^*$.  If the SEDs of galaxies and stars
were the same, then the effect of DCR would be to add $V$ to both
$I^o$ and $I^*$, which would then cancel when computing $I^g$ and
subsequently galaxy shape parameters.  The differences between stellar
and galactic SEDs, however, will introduce a small error $\Delta V \ll
r^2$ into $I_{xx}$ and $r^2$, which leads to biases in the derived
ellipticity parameters:
\begin{equation}
  e_1 \rightarrow \frac{I_{xx} + I_{yy} + \Delta V}{r^2 + \Delta V} \approx e_1 \left(1 + \frac{\Delta V}{r^2}\right) + \frac{\Delta V}{r^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  e_2 \rightarrow \frac{2 I_{xy}}{r^2 + \Delta V} \approx e_2 \left(1 + \frac{\Delta V}{r^2}\right)
\end{equation}

Under the expectation that $\left<e_i\right> \approx 2\gamma_i$ and
defining the shear calibration parameters $m$ and $c$ such that
$\hat{\gamma} = \gamma (1 + m) + c$, where $\hat{\gamma}$ indicates
the estimator for the true shear $\gamma$, we reach the expectation
that $m$ = $\frac{\Delta V}{r^2}$, $c_1 = m/2$, and $c_2 = 0$.  Note
that nowhere in the above analysis is there any assumption on the
profile of the galaxy in question.

\section{Ring test}\label{sec:ringtest}
An alternative way to estimate the bias in $\hat{\gamma}$ induced by
DCR is to simulate galaxy images using the ``true'' (galactic) PSF and
then attempt to recover the simulated galactic ellipticities while
pretending that the PSF is ``wrong'' (stellar).  A ring test
\citep{Nakajima2007} is a specific prescription for such a suite of
simulations designed to rapidly converge to the correct value of
$\hat{\gamma}$.  The test gets its name from the arrangement of galaxy
shapes used in the simulated images, which form a ring in ellipticity
space (i.e. constant $|e|$), before any shear is applied.  By choosing
intrinsic ellipticities that exactly average to zero, the results of
the test converge faster than for randomly (but isotropically) chosen
ellipticities that only average to zero statistically.

The general procedure can be implemented as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose an input ``true'' reduced shear $g$
  \item Choose a pre-sheared ellipticity $e^s = (e_1^s, e_2^s)$
  \item Compute the sheared ellipticity from $e^o = \frac{e^s+g}{1+g^*e^s}$
  \item Generate a ``truth'' image by convolving the galaxy model with
    the ``true'' PSF (galactic in this case)
  \item Using a ``reconstruction'' PSF (stellar in this case), find
    the best fitting model to the ``truth'' image, record the measured
    ellipticity from the model parameters
  \item Repeat steps 3-5 using the opposite pre-sheared ellipticity
    $-e^s$
  \item Repeat steps 2-6 for as many values around the ellipticity
    ring as desired
  \item Average all recorded output ellipticity values.  This is the
    shear estimate $\hat{g}$
  \item Repeat steps 1-8 to map out the relation $g(\hat{g})$
  \item $m$ and $c$ are the slope and intercept of the best-fit linear
    relation between $g$ and $\hat{g}$ (note we assume that $g \approx
    \gamma$)
\end{enumerate}

As described above, the ring test requires some prescription for
creating galaxy images with a given ellipticity.  Here we investigate
using a single Sersic profile as the galaxy model.  The Sersic profile
has 7 parameters: the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the center, the total
flux, the effective radius $r_e$ (also called the half-light radius),
the two component ellipticity $\mathbf{e}$, and the Sersic index $n$.
Using $r$ as an elliptical radial coordinate, the profile shape is:
\begin{equation}
  I(r) \propto \mathrm{e}^{[-k (r/r_e)^2]^{\frac{1}{2 n}}}
\end{equation}
The constant $k \approx 1.9992 n - 0.3271$ is chosen such that $r_e$
is the half-light radius for a circularized profile.  Limiting cases
of the Sersic profile include the Gaussian profile which has $n=0.5$,
an exponential profile which has $n=1.0$, and a de Vaucouleurs profile
which has $n=4.0$.  The profile ranges from smoothly peaked with small
tails at low $n$ (such as an $n=0.5$ Gaussian), to very sharply peak
with heavy tails (such as an $n=4.0$ deVaucoulers profile).

In addition to a galaxy model, the ring test also requires a model for
the PSF.  We have described above the PSF kernel that describes the
contribution of DCR, but other contributions to the PSF also exist,
due to atmospheric turbulence, telescope optics, and the detector for
example.  Ground based telescope PSFs are usually dominated by
atmospheric turbulence, and are frequently modeled by a Moffat
profile:
\begin{equation}
  I_p(r) \propto \left(1+\left(\frac{r}{\alpha}\right)^2\right)^{-\beta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{\mathrm{FWHM}}{2\sqrt{2^{1/\beta}-1}}
\end{equation}
The PSF used in the ring test in this note is based on a Moffat
profile with a FWHM of $0$\farcs$7$ and softening parameter $\beta =
2.6$.  This base PSF is then convolved (in the zenith direction only)
with the DCR kernel given in Equation \ref{eqn:convker}.  The ``true''
PSF uses a DCR kernel derived from a galaxy SED, while the
``reconstruction'' PSF uses a DCR kernel derived from a stellar SED.

\section{Sersic index dependence}\label{sec:sersic}

The results of the ring test for set of Sersic galaxies are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:mandc}.  The galaxy size quantified by $r^2$ is the
same for each Sersic index.  The ring test results match the analytic
formulae well when Gaussian galaxies ($n=0.5$) are used, but diverge
by factors of 2-3 when de Vaucouleurs profiles ($n=4.0$) are used.
The PB12 analytic formalism has no dependence on the profile of the
galaxy, but only on the assumption that the differential dispersion
kernel is much smaller than the size of the unsmeared galaxy ($\Delta
V \ll r^2$).  This condition is met identically for each profile by
construction, suggesting either that something is flawed with the PB12
formalism or with the ring test.

  formalism.  The zenith angle is 30 degrees.}

\section{Ring test case study}\label{sec:casestudy}

To investigate the ring test in more detail, we have conducted a case
study focusing on the redshift 1.25 galaxy that shows the largest $m$
and $c$ values in both the ring test results and the PB12 results.
For this study, we have constructed a series of diagnostic images
showing the results of the fits in Step 5 of the ring test for each of
the Sersic indices studied.  These diagnostic images are shown in
Figures \ref{fig:gauss}, \ref{fig:exp}, and \ref{fig:deV}.  Note that
the diagnostic figures were generated for a zenith angle of 60 degrees
for better visualization, though the qualitative results are the same
at 30 degrees.

In Figures \ref{fig:gauss}, \ref{fig:exp}, and \ref{fig:deV}, the
``truth'' image is shown in the top right panel.  The panel
immediately below this one is the best fit to the ``truth'' image
possible using the ``wrong'' PSF, which in this case is the PSF
generated from the G5v stellar spectrum.  The leftmost panel in the
second row shows the above-atmosphere galaxy model used to create this
``best fit'' image.  The rightmost panel in the third row shows the
residual between the ``truth'' image and the ``best fit'' image, and
is an indication of the quality of the fit in Step 5 of the ring test.
If the fit were perfect, then the residual image would be entirely
zeros.

The reason the residual image is not entirely filled with zeros is due
to ``model bias'' \citep{Melchior2009, Voigt2010, Bernstein2010}.  The
fitting step can be viewed as an attempt at deconvolution of the
``truth'' image by the ``wrong'' PSF under the assumption that the
functional form of the deconvolved image is known.  The best fit model
(second row, first column) is the result of this attempted
deconvolution, and the ellipticity parameters can then simply be read
off as the parameters that generated the model.  In practice, however,
the true deconvolved image (i.e. the true deconvolution of the
``truth'' image by the ``wrong'' PSF, not computed or shown in any of
the Figure panels) will not always be an instance of the functional
form of the fit.  More generally, the true deconvolution may not even
have elliptical isophotes, precluding a solution by simply adding
degrees of freedom to the radial profile of the functional form.
(Degrees of freedom can, of course, be added {\it azimuthally} to get
a perfect deconvolution, but then the ellipticity can no longer be
simply read off as a model parameter).

The degree to which the ring test results are biased by model fitting
depends on how well the deconvolution is able to function.  Larger
residuals to the fit are more susceptible to bias.  Comparing Figures
\ref{fig:gauss}, \ref{fig:exp}, and \ref{fig:deV}, we see visually
that the residuals grow with the Sersic index, which explains how the
$n=4.0$ curve of Figure \ref{fig:mandc} became so different than the
analytic prediction.  All of the curves are subject to bias both model
bias and bias from DCR, but the $n=4.0$ curve is the most sensitive to
model bias.  The visual comparison is backed up by the data in Table
\ref{table:fitqual}.  As the Sersic index increases, the best fit
$\chi^2$ also increases indicating a worse fit.  From the quadrupole
moments of the residuals, one can define a Figure of Demerit:
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{FoD} = I^r_{xx} + I^r_{yy}
\end{equation}
where $I^r$ is the residual image.  The Figure of Demerit also
increases with Sersic index, indicating an increasing model bias.

\end{deluxetable*}


Presumably, better ellipticity measurement algorithms would show less
dependence on the Sersic index.  For instance, the algorithms
described in \citet{Bernstein2010} and \citet{Melchior2011} both aim
to mitigate model bias.  If Step 5 of the ring test were replaced with
one of these algorithms for measuring ellipticity, then maybe the
effect of DCR could better be isolated from the effects of model bias.
